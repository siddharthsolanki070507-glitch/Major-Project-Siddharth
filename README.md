                                           Student Marks Management System

Project Description

The Student Marks Management System is a menu-driven C program designed to automate basic student result processing.
It allows the user to enter student details such as name, roll number, number of subjects, and marks for each subject.
After entering the data, the program calculates the total marks obtained and computes the percentage based on the number of subjects.
It also displays a complete student report containing all the entered information along with the calculated percentage.
The system uses fundamental C programming concepts like functions, loops, arrays, conditional statements, and string handling.
Since the program runs in a loop, the user can perform multiple operations such as entering details, calculating percentage, displaying the report, clearing the screen, and exiting. This makes the program simple, interactive, and suitable for academic result management at the beginner level.


Instructions for Running the Project
To operate the Student Marks Management System, begin by running the program to access the main menu. From the menu, select the appropriate option by entering its corresponding number. When entering student details, provide the student’s name, roll number, number of subjects, and the marks for each subject, ensuring that all values are entered accurately. After the details are stored, choose the calculation option to compute the total marks and percentage based on the subjects entered. You can then view the complete student report, which displays all the stored information in a structured format. The system also offers an option to clear the screen for a cleaner display before performing additional operations. Once you are finished using the program, select the exit option to close the application safely.
